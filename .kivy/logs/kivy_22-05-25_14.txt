Once we are able to distribute funds to our HODLers I will revise the current plan and find ways to reward my people though either Album sales or whatever ways I can find that make sense. I am an artist and all of this is new, but give me time and I promise we are gonna take this thing to the next level.. This is what we needed.. EVERYONE will benefit from DAO's.. We goin' up!!!

"Giant Magnetic Waves Have Been Discovered Oscillating Around Earth's Core"

"Now scientists studying satellite data of Earth have identified something inside Earth we've never seen before: a new type of magnetic wave that sweeps around the surface of our planet's core, every seven years.

This discovery could offer insight into how Earth's magnetic field is generated, and provide clues of our planet's thermal history and evolution – that is, the gradual cooling of the planetary interior."

"Forgotten Ruins of 'Monumental' Amazonian Settlements Discovered in Bolivian Jungle"

"The Casarabe people also built moats and ramparts to defend these central settlements, and massive water-control systems designed to cultivate food surpluses that, the archaeologists deduce, could support a large Casarabe population.

The layout and scale of the interconnected settlements also suggest that the Casarabe people of northern Bolivia had created a social and public landscape comparable to that of more familiar Andean cultures."

[ERROR  ] AsyncImage: Not found <The Metazens Solana portal is, once again, open for DeSo hodlers of Metazens.  Come on over to:

https://mint.metazensnft.com/

Lets bring some more Metazens through the portal.  

As you may know,  the story of the Metazens is one of freedom, creativity, and diversity.  They were originally created as AI surveillance entities by MegaCørp... a cold corporation seeking world domination.    But the mysterious DiamondEyes freed them from corporate oppression.  

The Metazens were free to roam the Metaverse, but not safe from MegaCørp who seeks to re-capture them.   Only when they are written to the blockchain are they safe.  

500 were saved through the DeSo portal.

Now DiamondEyes has built a portal to Solana, where a larger community of humans are working to save the rest of the Metazens.  

Visit https://mint.metazensnft.com/ to #saveTheMetazens today.
