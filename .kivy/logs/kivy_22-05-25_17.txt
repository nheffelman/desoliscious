(There really needs to be a memory bank feature) something you can put whatever you want without it appearing on the feed for anyone to see. But if it’s just for you then it’s easy to dump things. Like a ton of pics or write ideas, recipes or whatever. Basically a space to do anything and for it to not show up on the global feed or be shown to those who follow you on the normal feed. And if someone really wanted to see it then they could just go to that person’s profile and click, “memory bank” and watch what’s been posted there. But they have to go there to see it. >
